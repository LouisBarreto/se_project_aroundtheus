Project 3: Around The U.S.

Overview: This project presents straightforward profile features that enable users to upload and modify their information. Other users will be able to view these profiles and "like" them (feature coming soon).

Technologies Used:
-Figma
-Flexbox/Grid
-@media quaries
-Html/CSS

**This project is made so all the elements are displayed correctly on popular screen sizes. We recommend investing more time in completing this project, since it's more difficult than previous ones.**

**Figma**

**Images**

**The way you'll do this at work is by exporting images directly from Figma — we recommend doing that to practice more. Don't forget to optimize them [here](https://tinypng.com/), so your project loads faster.**

Good luck and have fun!
